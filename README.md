Welcome to the ALPHA of Church CRM

This is currently very much in the alpha stages, but the aim is to create a functioning CRM to aid ministers in keeping
in touch with congregation members, tracking todo lists, calendaring, and follow up of life events (Occasional Offices).G

Many of the CRM's currently on the market for Churches are very much aimed at the American "Get Money" model, and because of the size of the churches can be very much be a sledge-hammer to crack a nut. This CRM is designed to be small, FREE, and useful
in a predominantly UK context, but hopefully flexible enough to work anywhere. 

The work is inspired by the work of Dr. Millar, trying to bring some of her ideas into a physical form.
